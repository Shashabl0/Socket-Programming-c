multi client project


create server client socket program which
* has common server for data flow
* each client can send multiple msgs
* each client can receive multiple msgs

future objectives 
* create buffer memory to store data if one goes off


further ideas:-
add name field in struct Client
then view available Client in server
and message a particular client from one client


if i say i have like max allowed client is 5, then
