This folder contains two client server.c files
now in client.c server.c only two client can chat with each other over a server.
In client2.c and server2.c Client can list nclient connected to server, SEND function is still not yet completed..

[edit 26-07-2021 11:44 pm] SEND function completed, I had to removed a part where client can deny a connection
